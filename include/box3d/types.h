 * @defgroup events Events
 * World event types.
 *
 * Events are used to collect events that occur during the world time step. These events
 * are then available to query after the time step is complete. This is preferable to callbacks
 * because Box3D uses multithreaded simulation.
 *
 * Also when events occur in the simulation step it may be problematic to modify the world, which is
 * often what applications want to do when events occur.
 *
 * With event arrays, you can scan the events in a loop and modify the world. However, you need to be careful
 * that some event data may become invalid. There are several samples that show how to do this safely.
